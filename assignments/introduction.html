    <p>My name is Ayisha. My native place is Vijayawada. I completed my <b>Mtech</b> in Computer science and engineering. I got married a year ago. At present I am living in hyderabad. <br>
        I love to code as I am very much interested in logics from childhood. My love for mathematics gave me <u>full marks</u> in many public exams from schools days. With that love I took CSE as my core in my Btech and completed with good percentage. Due to personal reasons I never tried for a job. But now with my husband and family's support I want to do a job. So I started or I can say I restarted my study with full stack python in <i>NareshiT</i>. I am hoping good future ahead.
